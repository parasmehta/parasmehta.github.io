{"name":"Paras Mehta","tagline":"","body":"### Hi!\r\nI am a PhD candidate at the Databases and Information Systems working group at FU Berlin. My supervisor is [Prof. Agnès Voisard](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/voisard/desktop.html) \r\n\r\n### Previous\r\nTill Sept 2014, I was a member of the European project [GEOCROWD] (http://www.geocrowd.eu) and a recipient of the [Marie Curie](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) fellowship. Before that I had the chance to work at [Consult Hyperion](http://www.chyp.com/) as Software Engineer. \r\n\r\nI did MSc in Computer Science with the [Erasmus Mundus](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/) scholarship. which was one of the best experiences in my life! I studied what I love with people from 16 different countries in three different countries- England, Spain and Greece :-). My thesis was on securing mobile commerce using XML Signature and Encryption, with [Prof. Mario Muñoz Organero](http://www.it.uc3m.es/mario/indice.html). My Bachelors degree is in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Delhi College of Engineering](http://www.dce.edu/).\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nMy research is in application of user generated geospatial data for targeting and personalization of incident notifications.\r\n\r\n### Thesis proposals\r\nCurrently open proposal for Masters Thesis with me - [Implementation and evaluation of an improved spatial keyword index](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/ag-db/Theses/spatial_keyword_index/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n+ Müller, S., Mehta, P., & Voisard, A.
