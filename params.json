My supervisor is [Prof. Agnès Voisard](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/voisard/desktop.html) \r\n\r\n### Previous\r\nTill Sept 2014, I was a member of the European project [GEOCROWD] (http://www.geocrowd.eu). Before that I had the chance to work at [Consult Hyperion](http://www.chyp.com/) as Software Engineer. I did my MSc in Computer Science with the Erasmus Mundus scholarship. It was the best experiences in my life. Which other scholarship gives one the chance to live in England, Spain and Greece! My thesis was on securing mobile commerce using XML Signature and Encryption, with [Prof. Mario Muñoz Organero](http://www.it.uc3m.es/mario/indice.html). \r\n\r\n### Research\r\nMy research is in applications of user generated geospatial data in alerting and personalization of information.\r\n\r\n### Thesis proposals\r\nCurrently open Master Thesis proposal - [Implementation and evaluation of an improved spatial keyword index](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/ag-db/Theses/spatial_keyword_index/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n+ Müller, S., Mehta, P., & Voisard, A.
